# DorDor Lite (Starter)

A minimal static homepage to mimic the *feel* of dordorstore's top navigation and a blank home image grid.

## How to run locally
Open `index.html` in your browser, or use VS Code's Live Server extension.

## How to deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo on GitHub (public is easiest for Pages).
2. Push this folder as the repo content.
3. In GitHub **Settings → Pages**, choose **Deploy from a branch**, select `main` and folder `/ (root)`.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes. Your site will be at `https://<username>.github.io/<repo>`.
